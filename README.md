# Crafter Kotlin

Crafter is my game engine like Minecraft Alpha. This is my hobby.

(This is a new discord server because I'm trying to fix my discord mess)

## Important notes:
- Right now I'm in the process of removing the external scripting engine because it makes it
far too difficult to maintain as a solo developer.
- I have taken a long break from Kotlin and JDK dev to focus on looking at other programming languages,
it's going to take me a bit to get back into my flow.

## Current goals:
- Remove groovy garbage. Move it into internal.
- Simplify development goals.
- Break this thing down. Simplify how it works.
- Use packages instead of same namespace objects cause why the HECK is it like this?

## Recommended platform tools for dev:

sdkman: https://sdkman.io/

Then you're going to want to install:

- openjdk 22
- gradle 8.8

as of the time of writing this you can do:

```
sdk install java 22-open
sdk install gradle
sdk install kotlin
```

If this becomes outdated feel free to tell me.

IntelliJ Community: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

You can install any IDE you'd like but working with Kotlin, IntelliJ simply makes it easier.
