# Crafter Kotlin

Crafter is my game engine like Minecraft Alpha. This is my hobby.

(This is a new discord server because I'm trying to fix my discord mess)

Right now I'm in the process of removing the external scripting engine because it makes it
far too difficult to maintain as a solo developer.

Recommended platform tools for dev:

sdkman: https://sdkman.io/

Then you're going to want to install:

- openjdk 22
- gradle 8.8

as of the time of writing this you can do:

```
sdk install java 22-open
sdk install gradle
```

If this becomes outdated feel free to tell me.

IntelliJ Community: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

You can install any IDE you'd like but working with Kotlin, IntelliJ simply makes it easier.
